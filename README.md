# QuoteGuesser

1. Plan your gem, imagine interface
2. Start with the project structure
3. Start with the entry point - the file run
4. Force that to build the CLI interface
5. stub out the interface
6. start making things real
7. discover objects
8. program

Project Requirements
Provide a CLI
Your CLI application must provide access to data from a web page.
The data provided must go at least one level deep. A "level" is where a user can make a choice and then get detailed information about their choice. Some examples are below:
Movies opening soon - Enter your zip code and receive a list of movies and their details.
Libraries near you - Enter your zip code and receive a list of libraries and their details.
Programming meetups near you - Choose from an events list and receive details.
News reader - List articles and read an article of your choosing.
Your CLI application should not be too similiar to the Ruby final projects (Music Library CLI, Tic-Tac-Toe with AI, Student Scraper). Also, please refrain from using Kickstarter as that was used for the scraping 'code along'.
Use good OO design patterns. You should be creating a collection of objects, not hashes, to store your data. Pro Tip: Avoid scraping data more than once per web page - utilize objects you have already created. It will speed up your program!

user types quote-guesser

The user gets a random quote

They have to guess whether the quote was by typing Adam Neumann or RuPaul

scrapes https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/adam_neumann and https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/rupaul

returns a random quote from one of the two websites

the user has to type "RuPaul" or "adam neumann" to guess who it is

returns true or false

I discovered my ruby version wasn't up to date so found these isntructions: http://codingpad.maryspad.com/2017/04/29/update-mac-os-x-to-the-current-version-of-ruby/
I set up the CLI file and a class to match what the interface will do with the user by watching the walkthrough video closely. I am doing this on my own atom editor instead of the IDE. I initialized git and made my first commit, remembering to commit every so often and push to my github account.

I made the shell of the program in the class QuoteGuesser::CLI to include a call method that gets the whole interface started and asks the user to guess who said the quote given, and if they are wrong, the option to keep trying to guess. They can also see a bio of the authors.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'quote_guesser'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install quote_guesser

## Usage

Use this as a fun guessing game for students in a classroom for motivational quotes, or for employees of wework to enjoy the thoughts of our CEO

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
